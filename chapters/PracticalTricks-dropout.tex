\begin{itemize}
    \item Randomly drop out hidden units (set to zero) and input features
          during training.
    \item Each time a different model is trained and the final model is the
          mean of all trained models.
    \item Prevents feature co-adaptation detectors and overfitting.
\end{itemize}
